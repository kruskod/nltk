Segmentation Metrics
=======

The `nltk.metrics.segmentation` package provides a variety of
*evaluation measures* which can be used for evaluating text
segmentation methods

    >>> from nltk.metrics.segmentation import *
    >>> from nltk.metrics.segmentation.ghd import *
    >>> from nltk.metrics.segmentation.pk import *
    >>> from nltk.test.doctest_utils import *

Generalized Hamming Distance
------------------

Generalized Hamming Distance may be used as an evaluation metric
for text segmentation. It compares two segmentation, and return
an estimation of the cost to transform a segmentation into another.
The transformation is done though boundary insertions, deletions and shift.
Each of these operation has a different cost that should be passed to the function.
Segmentations are represented using strings of 0 and 1, 1 being a boundary.

    >>> ghd('1100100000', '1100010000', 1.0, 1.0, 0.5)
    0.5
    >>> ghd('1100100000', '1100000001', 1.0, 1.0, 0.5)
    2.0
    >>> ghd('011', '110', 1.0, 1.0, 0.5)
    1.0
    >>> ghd('1', '0', 1.0, 1.0, 0.5)
    1.0
    >>> ghd('111', '000', 1.0, 1.0, 0.5)
    3.0
    >>> ghd('000', '111', 1.0, 2.0, 0.5)
    6.0
