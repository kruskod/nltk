Crubadan Corpus Reader
======================

Crubadan is an NLTK corpus reader for ngram files provided
by the Crubadan project. It supports several languages.

    >>> from nltk.corpus import crubadan
    >>> crubadan.langs()

----------------------------------------
Language code mapping and helper methods
----------------------------------------

The web crawler that generated the 3-gram frequencies works at the
level of "writing systems" rather than languages. These are assigned
internal 2-3 letter "writing system codes" that require mapping to the
standard ISO 639-3 codes.

For details, please refer to the README in nltk_data/crubadan
folder after installing it.

To translate ISO 639-3 codes to "Crubadan Code":

    >>> crubadan.iso_to_crubadan('eng')
    'en'
    >>> crubadan.iso_to_crubadan('fra')
    'fr'
    >>> crubadan.iso_to_crubadan('aaa')
    None

In reverse, print ISO 639-3 code if we have the Crubadan Code:

    >>> crubadan.crubadan_to_iso('en')
    'eng'
    >>> crubadan.crubadan_to_iso('fr')
    'fra'
    >>> crubadan.crubadan_to_iso('aa')
    None

---------------------------
Accessing ngram frequencies
---------------------------

On initialization, the reader will create a dictionary of every
language supported by the Crubadan project, mapping the ISO 639-3
language code to its corresponding ngram frequency.

The end result is a dictionary of FreqDists representing all the
languages that can be accessed via "all_lang_freq":

    >>> crubadan.all_lang_freq # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    {'roh': FreqDist({'<da': 33783, ...})}

You can access individual language FreqDist and the ngrams within them as follows:
say you're interested in knowing the frequency of the ngram 'the' in English:

    >>> english_fd = crubadan.all_lang_freq['eng']
    >>> english_fd['the']
    728135

Alternatively, you may use the "lang_freq" method to retrieve the FreqDist
directly, simply pass the ISO 639-3 code for the language you're interested in:

    >>> crubadan.lang_freq('eng') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    FreqDist({'<th': 954187, 'the': 728135, 'he>': 655273, 'ing': 360758, 'nd>': 359481, 'ng>':
    351373, '<an': 345633, '<to': 333091, 'ed>': 329517, '<of': 316431, ...})

A companion convenience method to above is "ngram_freq", which can be
used to retrieve a specific ngram frequecy more explicitly. As usual, 
pass in the language of interest by its ISO 639-3 code and the ngram
of interest. Using the example above to get the frequency of 'the' in English:

    >>> crubadan.ngram_freq('eng', 'the')
    728135

A ngram that isn't found within the language will return 0:

    >>> crubadan.ngram_freq('eng', 'test')
    0

A language that isn't supported will raise an exception:

    >>> crubadan.ngram_freq('elvish', 'test')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CrubadanError: Unsupported language [elvish]
